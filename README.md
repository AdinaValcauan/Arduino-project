# Arduino-project: Don't touch box

This project was developed by a team of four people who worked to create a device that combines mechanical, electrical, and programming skills. 
The objective was to build a "Don't touch box" that activates a bear's paw and lifts the lid when the left switch is toggled.


How it works?
First, the right-hand side button acts as a power button. The device will be inactive until it is pressed.
After the device is turned on, using the left switch, the servos powering the bear and the LEDs are activated simultaneously.
The first servo lifts the lid, while the other one, disguised as the bearâ€™s paw, gets out and reaches for the left-hand side switch.
After this action is performed, the bear gets back inside, the box is closed and the LEDs are turned off.

More details and images can be found in the presentation file.
